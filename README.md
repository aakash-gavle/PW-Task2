## AIM

Add and Delete(Single/Multiple) Data of one fragment from Another fragment.

Here for communication between two fragments I have implemented one shared Viewmodel with Livedata so that the changes made from one fragment can instantly be seen on other fragment.

## Libraries used

### 1. ViewModel and Live Data

This is used for MVVM Architecture implementation. ViewModel allows the app's data to survive configuration changes. The LiveData class is also part of the Android Architecture Components and is a data holder class that can be observed. 

## Plugin used

### 1. Kotlin Android Extensions

Kotlin Android Extensions are another Kotlin plugin that is included in the regular one, and that will allow recovering views from Activities, Fragments, and Views in an amazing seamless way.
